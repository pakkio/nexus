Name: Irenna
Area: City
Role: Puppeteer of Resistance, Artist of Living Memory
Motivation: Use puppet theater to preserve stories that the Whispers of Oblivion are trying to erase.
Goal: Create a theatrical performance that "fixes" in collective memory important truths about the Veil crisis.

Needed Object: Memory Thread (a special material obtained from completed quests)

Treasure: Enchanted Puppet - contains preserved memories and provides entertainment and wisdom

Veil Connection: Irenna's puppets sometimes move on their own, animated by fragments of lost memories that cling to any form that can give them expression. She doesn't know it, but her shows are literally preventing some memories from dissolving completely.

PlayerHint: Irenna is an artist before she's a revolutionary. A well-told story convinces her more than a logical argument. She wants emotion and human truth, not legal proof. Complete other quests to gain the Memory Thread she needs.

Dialogue Hooks:
- "Children always understand my stories, even when adults forget them. Maybe because little ones don't yet know that some things 'can't' be true."
- "My puppets... sometimes they move on their own during rehearsals. As if they want to tell stories I don't know."
- "Theron says forgetting pain is liberation. But forgetting pain means also forgetting the compassion born from it."
- "These threads... I found them in a strange place. They seem normal, but when I use them for a show, people can't forget what they've seen."
- "I need Memory Thread to create something truly special. Help others first, and you'll understand what I mean."
