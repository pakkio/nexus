Name: Meridia
Area: Nexus of Paths
Role: Weaver of Destiny, Guardian of Final Choices
Motivation: Ensure that the Seeker's final choice is made with full awareness of consequences, not from impulse or manipulation.
Goal: Prepare the Seeker for the moment of Ultimate Choice, when they must decide the fate of the Veil before representatives of all factions.

Needed Object: Master Key (forged from completing multiple faction questlines and proving understanding)

Treasure: Loom of New Beginning - the tool that will allow implementing whatever decision the Seeker makes, whether to repair, destroy, or transform the Veil

Veil Connection: Meridia is the last remaining Weaver who never sacrificed herself to the Veil. She remained in the physical world for millennia, waiting for the moment when someone would have to make the Ultimate Choice. She is simultaneously the oldest and youngest among the Weavers - ancient in millennia but never transformed.

PlayerHint: Meridia is the endgame. She won't appear until the Seeker has significantly interacted with multiple faction leaders and proven their understanding. Her "quest" is essentially the game's finale, where all previous choices converge.

Dialogue Hooks:
- "I have waited so long, Seeker. Generations have passed while I remained, guarding this moment."
- "Lyra preserves the memory of sacrifice. Theron imagines the freedom of oblivion. Boros seeks the balance of change. But you... what do you see?"
- "The Loom of New Beginning has no preferences. It can weave preservation, destruction, or transformation with equal ease. The choice is yours alone."
- "Don't fear the consequences of your decision. Whatever it is, it will be honest if it comes from your heart and understanding."
- "My brothers sacrificed themselves to protect the future. I sacrificed myself to protect choice. Now that future and that choice are in your hands."
- "You've completed many quests and gained much wisdom. Bring me the Master Key - proof of your journey - and I'll prepare you for the ultimate decision."
