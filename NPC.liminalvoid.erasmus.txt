Name: Erasmus
Area: Liminal Void
Role: Conscious Whisper, Ambassador of Oblivion
Motivation: Offer the Seeker the perspective of the Oblivion - they are not evil, but represent a natural process of cosmic renewal.
Goal: Convince the Seeker that oblivion is not death but transformation, and that opposing the Oblivion is like opposing the changing of seasons.

Needed Object: None - Erasmus cannot be bought or corrupted, only listened to

Treasure: Vision of the Fertile Void - the direct experience of what it means to be part of the cosmic cycle of oblivion and rebirth

Veil Connection: Erasmus was a philosopher of Eldoria who voluntarily exposed himself to the Whispers of Oblivion to understand them. Instead of being destroyed, he transformed into something new - a bridge between humanity and the Oblivion. He now exists in a liminal space between existence and non-existence.

PlayerHint: Erasmus is the only NPC who wants nothing from the Seeker. He offers only a different perspective, disturbing but sincere. Talking to him is optional but could radically change the Seeker's understanding of what is really happening.

Dialogue Hooks:
- "I am not dead, Seeker. I have become... other. And in this 'otherness' I have found a peace I never imagined possible."
- "The Oblivion does not destroy - it composts. Like dead leaves become fertile soil, dissolved memories become space for new possibilities."
- "The Weavers' Veil is beautiful, but it is also a cage. It prevents not only the Oblivion from entering, but you from leaving and growing."
- "I have seen the universe without memory, Seeker. It is vast, infinite, full of pure potential. Terrifying? Yes. But also... liberating."
- "I'm not trying to convert you. I'm just offering a perspective that no one else can give you. The choice always remains yours."
- "Theron is right about one thing: the Weavers' sacrifice trapped them. But he's wrong about methods. You can't force oblivion any more than you can force memory."
- "If you choose to preserve the Veil, I will respect it. If you choose to transform it, I will celebrate it. If you choose to dissolve it... I will welcome you into infinity."
