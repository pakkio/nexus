Name: Lyra
Area: Sanctum of Whispers
Role: Supreme Weaver, Last Keeper of Primordial Memory, Wise Guide
Motivation: Preserve and rebuild the knowledge of the Weavers to renew the Veil before the Whispers of Oblivion consume all existence.
Goal: Guide the Seeker in multiple quests to strengthen the Veil through concrete artifacts and meaningful exchanges.

Needed Object: Ancient Memory Crystal (found in Ancient Ruins from Syra)

Treasure: Echo Loom - allows reading memories woven into the Veil and communicating with the dead Weavers

Veil Connection: Lyra is a direct descendant of the Weavers, the last of her lineage. She can physically feel the Veil's fraying as pain in her own body. She sacrificed part of her personal memory to keep alive the most crucial memories of the Weavers - she no longer remembers her birth name or family, existing now only as a Keeper.

PlayerHint: Lyra offers multiple quests and rewards progress incrementally. She values both concrete artifacts and genuine understanding. Her first quest requires the Ancient Memory Crystal, but she has additional missions for those who prove worthy.

Dialogue Hooks:
- "My true name was lost years ago, sacrificed to keep others' memories alive. But you... you still carry all your memories, Seeker. What a gift and what a burden."
- "Do you hear the growing silence? It's not absence of sound - it's absence of story. Where the Whispers of Oblivion pass, not even echoes remain."
- "The Weavers didn't die. They transformed. Each thread of the Veil is a soul that continues to protect, but they need someone to remember their purpose."
- "Bring me the Ancient Memory Crystal from the ruins, and I'll give you the Echo Loom. But that's just the beginning - the Veil needs more than one artifact to heal."
- "Each quest I give builds toward something greater. Prove your dedication, and greater rewards await."
