# 🌙 *The Shattered Veil* - Story & World Guide

## 📖 WORLD LORE

### The Veil: Not a Barrier, but a Living Sacrifice

Eldoria is not protected by a simple magical barrier. The Veil is a living fabric, woven from the souls and memories of an entire lost civilization: the **Weavers**.

Millennia ago, when the **Oblivion** – cosmic entities that feed on existence itself – threatened to consume reality, the Weavers voluntarily sacrificed themselves. Their souls were interwoven into a protective tapestry of **memories, dreams, and sacrifices**, wrapping Eldoria in an invisible cocoon.

---

### The Current Crisis: The Veil that Forgets

The Veil is not breaking: **it is forgetting**. The oldest threads, those that guarded the memory of the Original Sacrifice, begin to fray because no one remembers *why* the Veil exists.

Where tears open, the **Whispers of Oblivion** filter through: not physical monsters, but **fragments of nothingness** that erase stories, bonds, entire identities. Families disappear from memory. Books empty themselves. Traditions stop mid-sentence.

## ⚔️ THE THREE PHILOSOPHIES IN CONFLICT

### 🏛️ Memory Keepers (Preservationists)

* **Leader:** Lyra, Supreme Weaver
* **Philosophy:** Only by reconstructing the history of the Weavers and renewing the memory of the Original Sacrifice can the Veil be saved.
* **Objective:** Find the **Primordial Nodes** and awaken forgotten memory.

---

### ⚡ Progressives (Future Seekers)

* **Leader:** High Judge Theron
* **Philosophy:** The Veil is a golden prison. Oblivion is liberation from the weight of the past.
* **Objective:** Let the Veil dissolve and face the Oblivion with **technology and will**.

---

### ⚖️ Equilibrium Walkers (Balance Seekers)

* **Leader:** Boros, First Monk
* **Philosophy:** The Veil must **evolve**, not be preserved or destroyed.
* **Objective:** Transform it into something that honors the past without imprisoning the future.

## 🤖 AI-POWERED EXPERIENCE

### Multi-Model LLM System
The game uses specialized AI models for different purposes:

* **🟢 Dialogue LLM** - Powers dynamic NPC conversations
* **🟡 Profile Analysis LLM** - Builds your psychological profile based on choices
* **🔵 Guide Selection LLM** - Intelligently selects Lyra as the Wise Guide
* **🟠 Command Interpretation LLM** - Processes natural language input

### Real-Time Stats Monitoring
Track your AI interaction with comprehensive statistics:

```
/stats           # Quick dialogue stats + AI status overview
/session_stats   # Current session + all AI model breakdown  
/all_stats       # Complete multi-model dashboard
```

**Status Indicators:**
* 🟢 **Active** - AI model currently being used
* 🔴 **Inactive** - AI model not yet used in session

### Second Life Integration for Immersive Roleplay

Experience Eldoria directly in virtual worlds through **LSL integration**:

**🌐 Virtual World Deployment:**
* Deploy NPCs as interactive objects in Second Life
* Real-time conversations with AI-powered characters
* Contextual animations and gestures during dialogue
* In-world object interactions and references

**🎮 Enhanced Immersion Features:**
* **Avatar Context:** NPCs recognize your SL avatar name and region
* **Visual Commands:** NPCs trigger emotes, animations, and object interactions
* **Spatial Awareness:** References to nearby objects and locations
* **Dynamic Text:** Floating text updates based on story progression

**📡 Technical Implementation:**
```bash
# Launch SL-compatible interface
python lsl_main_gradio.py

# Test SL command generation
python test_sl_integration.py
```

**🎭 Example SL Experience:**
When talking to Lyra in the Sanctum, she might respond:
> *"The Veil remembers all who seek wisdom..."* 
> `[emote=bow][llSetText=Wisdom Seeker Welcomed][lookup=ancient_tome]`

This triggers: a bowing gesture, updates floating text, and highlights the ancient tome object in your virtual environment.

### Dynamic Character Profiling
Your psychological profile evolves based on:
* **Dialogue choices** with NPCs
* **Philosophical positions** taken
* **Decision patterns** in moral dilemmas
* **Interaction style** (respectful, aggressive, curious, etc.)
