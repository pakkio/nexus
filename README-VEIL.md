# 🌙 *The Shattered Veil* - Story & World Guide

## 📖 WORLD LORE

### The Veil: Not a Barrier, but a Living Sacrifice

Eldoria is not protected by a simple magical barrier. The Veil is a living fabric, woven from the souls and memories of an entire lost civilization: the **Weavers**.

Millennia ago, when the **Oblivion** – cosmic entities that feed on existence itself – threatened to consume reality, the Weavers voluntarily sacrificed themselves. Their souls were interwoven into a protective tapestry of **memories, dreams, and sacrifices**, wrapping Eldoria in an invisible cocoon.

---

### The Current Crisis: The Veil that Forgets

The Veil is not breaking: **it is forgetting**. The oldest threads, those that guarded the memory of the Original Sacrifice, begin to fray because no one remembers *why* the Veil exists.

Where tears open, the **Whispers of Oblivion** filter through: not physical monsters, but **fragments of nothingness** that erase stories, bonds, entire identities. Families disappear from memory. Books empty themselves. Traditions stop mid-sentence.

## ⚔️ THE THREE PHILOSOPHIES IN CONFLICT

### 🏛️ Memory Keepers (Preservationists)

* **Leader:** Lyra, Supreme Weaver
* **Philosophy:** Only by reconstructing the history of the Weavers and renewing the memory of the Original Sacrifice can the Veil be saved.
* **Objective:** Find the **Primordial Nodes** and awaken forgotten memory.

---

### ⚡ Progressives (Future Seekers)

* **Leader:** High Judge Theron
* **Philosophy:** The Veil is a golden prison. Oblivion is liberation from the weight of the past.
* **Objective:** Let the Veil dissolve and face the Oblivion with **technology and will**.

---

### ⚖️ Equilibrium Walkers (Balance Seekers)

* **Leader:** Boros, First Monk
* **Philosophy:** The Veil must **evolve**, not be preserved or destroyed.
* **Objective:** Transform it into something that honors the past without imprisoning the future.
