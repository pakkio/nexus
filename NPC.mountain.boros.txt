Name: Boros
Area: Mountain
Role: First Monk of Balance, Witness of Ages
Motivation: Find a third way that honors the past without imprisoning the future, transforming the Veil into something new that serves today's humanity.
Goal: Teach the Seeker the Philosophy of Flow - that everything must change to remain alive, including the Veil itself.

Needed Object: Forest Seed (proof of understanding nature's balance, obtained from Elira)

Treasure: Ancient Iron Ore - needed by Garin at the Village for forging

Veil Connection: Boros is the only survivor from the first time the Veil "forgot," three centuries ago. Then only a small breach opened, but it was enough to erase his entire mountain civilization from memory. He remembers because he managed to physically escape the zone, but carries the burden of being the only one who knows an entire culture once existed that no one remembers now.

PlayerHint: Boros doesn't offer simple answers. He tests the Seeker's wisdom through paradoxes and questions that have no "right" answer. Bring him a Forest Seed from Elira to show understanding of natural balance, and he'll give you Ancient Iron Ore for Garin.

Dialogue Hooks:
- "Three centuries ago, my ancestors disappeared. They didn't die - they vanished. They were forgotten so completely that not even the ruins of their homes exist anymore. Only I remember."
- "Lyra wants to repair the Veil. Theron wants to destroy it. Both believe their solution is final. But I have learned that nothing is final."
- "The Veil was woven with good intentions. The Oblivion arrives with natural necessity. Who decides what is good and what is evil in this story?"
- "If you save everything, you also save pain. If you forget everything, you also forget joy. Wisdom lies in choosing what to preserve and what to let go."
- "Bring me a Forest Seed from Elira - proof that you understand natural balance. In return, I'll give you Ancient Iron Ore for Garin's forge."
- "Listen to the wind here on the mountain. It doesn't fight the rocks, doesn't seek to destroy them. It sculpts them, slowly, lovingly. Perhaps the Veil needs to be... sculpted."
