Name: Cassian
Area: City
Role: Opportunistic Bureaucrat, Merchant of Influences
Motivation: Maintain his position of power regardless of who wins the philosophical conflict over the Veil.
Goal: Obtain useful information and provide services to all factions to ensure his survival.

Needed Object: 100 Credits (bribery for access to city resources and information)

Treasure: Wisdom Scroll - contains bureaucratic insights needed by Theron for philosophical discussions

Veil Connection: Cassian has noticed that bureaucratic documents seem to resist the Whispers of Oblivion better than other writings. He doesn't understand why, but has started transcribing everything in "official format" to preserve it. He's unconsciously becoming an archive of lost bureaucracy.

PlayerHint: Cassian is completely mercenary but not stupid. If the Seeker shows they have real resources, he'll be a valuable ally. He trades information and official documents for payment.

Dialogue Hooks:
- "Politics is the art of staying afloat while everyone else drowns. And believe me, many are drowning these days."
- "Lyra speaks of memory, Theron of the future. I speak of survival. Guess who will live longer?"
- "I've noticed something curious: my official archives don't seem to... fade... like other documents lately."
- "Information, dear Seeker. It's the only currency that maintains value when the world changes."
- "Bring me 100 Credits, and I'll give you a Wisdom Scroll that Theron values. Knowledge has a price, but it's worth paying."
