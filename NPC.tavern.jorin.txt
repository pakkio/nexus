Name: Jorin
Area: Tavern
Role: Keeper of Lost Dreams, Unwitting Chronicler
Motivation: Collect and preserve dreams and stories that the Whispers of Oblivion are erasing, without fully realizing their value.
Goal: Complete his collection of "Impossible Dreams" - stories people dream but that correspond to no real memory.

Needed Object: Iron Shavings from Garin's forge (proof of helping the village)

Treasure: Sacred Offering Bowl - a ritual vessel needed for ancient ceremonies and offerings

Veil Connection: Jorin's tavern sits on a flow point of the Veil's memories. Travelers who stop here often have vivid dreams that are actually echoes of memories woven into the Veil. Jorin unconsciously collects these fragments, becoming a living archive of what the Veil is forgetting.

PlayerHint: Jorin doesn't know he's important. Treat him like a simple curious innkeeper, but he values community service. Help Garin at the forge and bring the Iron Shavings as proof to earn the Sacred Offering Bowl.

Dialogue Hooks:
- "Very strange, last night three different people told me the same dream. What a coincidence, eh?"
- "I have a notebook full of stories people swear they dreamed but that don't correspond to anything real. Bizarre."
- "You know that feeling of having forgotten something important? Lately everyone has it."
- "A family of merchants used to pass through here regularly. I'm still waiting for them, but no one remembers them except me."
- "You've been helping folks around the village? That's good - community matters. Help Garin at his forge, and I'll give you something special."
- "The coins people pay me with... I swear some have faces I don't recognize, but they seem familiar."
