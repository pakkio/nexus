Name: High Judge Theron
Area: City
Role: Leader of the Progressives, Philosophical Revolutionary
Motivation: Free humanity from dependence on the Veil and the ghosts of the past, believing that only by directly confronting the Oblivion can humanity truly evolve.
Goal: Convince the Seeker that the Veil is a golden prison and that true strength lies in accepting oblivion and rebuilding identity from scratch.

Needed Object: Wisdom Scroll (proof of philosophical growth, obtained from various NPCs)

Treasure: Code of Tabula Rasa - a philosophical and magical technique for selectively erasing painful and limiting memories

Veil Connection: Theron has discovered he is immune to the Whispers of Oblivion - not because he is protected, but because his mind is so focused on the future that it has no "grip" for the past. This immunity has convinced him that oblivion is not an enemy but a teacher.

PlayerHint: Theron is not evil - he is genuinely convinced his way is better. He rewards those who show philosophical depth and understanding of different perspectives. Collect wisdom from multiple NPCs to earn his respect.

Dialogue Hooks:
- "Look around you, Seeker. How much pain do we carry for memories we cannot change? How much do we limit ourselves with fears inherited from those who are gone?"
- "Lyra sacrificed her own identity to preserve that of the dead. Does that seem healthy to you? Does it seem... human?"
- "The Weavers committed suicide, calling it sacrifice. What's the difference between their voluntary oblivion and what the Oblivion offers?"
- "I don't want to destroy the Veil out of malice. I want to destroy it out of mercy. Toward ourselves and toward the souls trapped in that prison of memory."
- "You've been learning from others? Good. Wisdom comes from understanding all perspectives, even those that challenge your beliefs."
- "If the Seeker is truly wise, they should doubt all our certainties. Even mine."
