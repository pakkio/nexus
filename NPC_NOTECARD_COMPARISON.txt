================================================================================

Core Principle:
NOTECARD BEHAVIOR MUST MATCH CHARACTER PERSONALITY

✅ Erasmus (refuses) = Maintains character integrity
   - Shows his true nature (non-materialist)
   - Teaches player about his philosophy through roleplay
   - Directs player to appropriate NPCs
   - Increases immersion through consistency

✅ Lyra (gives wisely) = Fulfills character archetype
   - Wisdom keepers naturally share knowledge
   - Rewards player for completing her quest
   - Provides useful story context
   - Matches her role as guide and preservationist

✅ Jorin (gives generously) = Reflects character values
   - Story collectors naturally share stories
   - Rewards player for community service
   - Builds atmosphere through dream collection
   - Matches his role as community anchor


================================================================================
LORE INTEGRATION
================================================================================

How Notecards Serve the Story:

Lyra's Pergamena:
- Provides official story context (antefatto)
- Helps player understand the Three Paths
- Reinforces Lyra's role in story guidance
- Creates persistent reference for complex plot

Jorin's Diary:
- Drops mysterious hints about Oblivion's effects
- Shows memory loss through collected dreams
- Builds atmosphere of mystery and loss
- Hints at deeper conspiracies at work

Erasmus's Refusal:
- Demonstrates his unique philosophy
- Shows character depth through roleplay
- Teaches player about different perspectives
- Redirects to other story sources


================================================================================
FUTURE POTENTIAL
================================================================================

Expandable to Other NPCs:
- Syra could give "Cronache Antiche" (Ancient Chronicles)
- Boros could give "Saggezza Ciclica" (Cyclic Wisdom)
- Elira could give "Segreti della Foresta" (Forest Secrets)
- Irenna could give "Libretto Rappresentazione" (Performance Script)

Each would follow same principle: CHARACTER CONSISTENCY


================================================================================
