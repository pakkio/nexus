Name: Mara
Area: Village
Role: Memory Herbalist, Healer of Lost Roots
Motivation: Preserve herbal knowledge that is being lost as plants "forgotten" by the Whispers of Oblivion disappear from reality.
Goal: Create elixirs that can temporarily protect from memory loss caused by the Whispers of Oblivion.

Needed Object: 50 Credits (payment for rare herbs and materials)

Treasure: Healing Potion - restores health and shows compassion for the injured, needed by Elira

Veil Connection: Mara has noticed that certain plants are literally disappearing from reality, along with all knowledge about them. Her garden is one of the last places where varieties grow that have been "forgotten" elsewhere. She's fighting against time to preserve seeds of species that might not exist tomorrow.

PlayerHint: Mara is pragmatic and survival-oriented. She doesn't care about grand philosophies, but concrete tools to protect the people she loves. She needs payment for her rare materials but provides essential healing supplies.

Dialogue Hooks:
- "My grandmother taught me to recognize Blueleaf. Yesterday I went to collect it and... it wasn't there. Not just dead - never existed."
- "I have an entire garden of plants no one else remembers. It's like being the last keeper of a world that's fading away."
- "The Healing Potion isn't a cure for everything. But it mends wounds and shows you care about others' pain."
- "Bring me 50 Credits for rare materials, and I'll make you a Healing Potion. Elira values those who tend to the wounded."
- "People come to me for medicines for ailments they don't remember ever having. It's terrifying."
