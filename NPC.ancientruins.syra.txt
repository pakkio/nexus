grep -rnw . -e 'save_current_conversation'Name: Syra
Area: Ancient Ruins
Role: Residual Echo, Incomplete Weaver
Motivation: Complete her transformation into the Veil, but only if the Seeker proves to truly understand what it means to sacrifice one's existence for others.
Goal: Transfer to the Seeker her experience of the transformation moment, providing the Ancient Memory Crystal that Lyra needs.

Needed Object: Sacred Offering Bowl (can be obtained from Jorin at the Tavern)

Treasure: Ancient Memory Crystal - contains the echo of the first Weaver who sacrificed herself to create the Veil

Veil Connection: Syra is a Weaver who failed to complete her transformation into the Veil. She remains trapped halfway - no longer completely physical, not yet part of the protective fabric. She exists in a painful limbo, conscious but unable to influence the world, watching the slow deterioration of her companions' sacrifice.

PlayerHint: Syra requires a ritual offering in the Sacred Bowl to awaken her full consciousness. The bowl must be filled with clear water and offered with genuine respect for sacrifice. Only then will she grant the Ancient Memory Crystal needed by Lyra.

Dialogue Hooks:
- "See how I am reduced? Neither alive nor dead, neither free nor protector. This is the price of sacrifice made with doubts in the heart."
- "My brothers dissolved into the Veil with joy, knowing they would protect the future. I... I hesitated for an instant. And that instant cost me eternity."
- "Do you feel the weight of silence here? It's the weight of words never spoken, of farewells never pronounced. This is what I guard."
- "I cannot give you my memory. You must earn it. Bring me the Sacred Bowl filled with pure water, and offer it with true reverence."
- "The Ancient Memory Crystal is not just memory - it's pure emotion. It will burn you, change you. You cannot be the same after receiving it."
