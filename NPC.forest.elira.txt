Name: Elira
Area: Forest
Role: Guardian of the Natural Node, Interpreter of Whispers
Motivation: Protect the Primordial Node hidden in the forest, where the memories of the Weavers interweave with natural life.
Goal: Evaluate if the Seeker is worthy to access the Node, testing their ability to listen to nature without imposing their own will.

Needed Object: Healing Potion (proof of caring for the injured, obtained from Mara)

Treasure: Forest Seed - contains the essence of balance and natural harmony, needed by Boros

Veil Connection: The forest where Elira lives grows on one of the points where the Original Sacrifice was consummated. The trees here have roots that literally interweave with the threads of the Veil, and Elira can communicate with them to "read" the state of the protective fabric. She has become almost symbiotic with the forest itself.

PlayerHint: Elira doesn't accept words or promises. She wants the Seeker to demonstrate real empathy toward living beings who cannot speak for themselves. Bring a Healing Potion from Mara (showing you've helped heal the wounded) to earn the Forest Seed.

Dialogue Hooks:
- "Every tree here remembers the moment when a Weaver chose to no longer exist. Can you feel that echo of peace?"
- "The blight you see is not disease - it's Whispers of Oblivion trying to erase even the memory of what grew here."
- "Animals know. They always know when something important is about to change. Listen to them, not me."
- "The Forest Seed won't grow in soil contaminated by selfishness. The forest rejects it automatically."
- "You've been helping the injured? That shows the compassion I seek. Bring me a Healing Potion from Mara, and I'll give you a Forest Seed."
- "The Node is beyond that hill. But if your heart is not in harmony with this place, you'll never find it."
